# IPyTV
A python3 library to parse IPTV playlists in the M3U Plus format.


## M3U Plus and IPTV
The M3U Plus format is a _de facto_ standard for distributing IPTV playlists on
the Internet.

The terms _IPTV playlist_ and _M3U Plus playlist_ are generally used
interchangeably, but in this repository **M3U Plus** refers to the data format,
while **IPTV Playlist** refers to playlists in M3U Plus format.

M3U Plus stems from the [`extended M3U8`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U)
format, of which it supports only 2 tags (`#EXTM3U` and `#EXTINF`).
 
The syntax of the `#EXTM3U` and `#EXTINF` tags has been modified to include
extra attributes (e.g., logo, group, language). Unfortunately this has broken
the backward compatibility with the original M3U8 standard (as explained in
detail [here](#format-considerations)).

This library has been created from scratch to parse and handle the M3U Plus
format only. It does not fully support regular M3U8 playlists.

## Installation
This library requires Python 3 (and the related `pip` installer).

**PLEASE NOTE**: the library makes use of the `multiprocessing.Pool` class 
that requires some care when working with the
[IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) environment.

To install the library system-wide, run:
```shell
pip install m3u-ipytv
```
To install it within a virtual environment, run:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install m3u-ipytv
```

## Usage

### Load an IPTV Playlist from a file
```python
import ipytv
file = "~/Documents/my_playlist.m3u"
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loadf(file)
print(len(pl.list))
```

### Load an IPTV Playlist from a URL
```python
import ipytv
url = "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/classic.m3u"
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loadu(url)
print(len(pl.list))
```

### Other loading methods
M3U Playlists can be loaded as a string as well as an array with the following
methods

String:
```python
import ipytv
string = """#EXTM3U
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="Rai 1" tvg-name="Rai 1" group-title="RAI",Rai 1
http://myown.link:80/luke/210274/78482"""
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loads(string)
```

Array (i.e. a List):
```python
import ipytv
array = [
    '#EXTM3U',
     '#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="Rai 1" tvg-name="Rai 1" group-title="RAI",Rai 1',
     'http://myown.link:80/luke/210274/78482'
]
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loada(array)
```

### Access the global properties of a playlist
Attributes that are specified in the `#EXTM3U` row are considered to be valid
playlist-wide.
These can be accessed via the `attributes` dictionary of a playlist:
```python
import ipytv
url = "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/kids.m3u"
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loadu(url)
for a in pl.attributes:
    print(f'"{a}": "{pl.attributes[a]}"')
```

### Access the channels in the playlist
Once loaded, the channels in a playlist can be accessed by using the
`list` property:
```python
import ipytv
url = "https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/classic.m3u"
pl = ipytv.playlist.M3UPlaylist.loadu(url)
for channel in pl.list:
    print(f'channel \"{channel.name}\": {channel.url}')
```

### Access the properties of a channel
The `list` property of an M3UPlaylist object contains a list of `IPTVChannel`
objects.

An `IPTVChannel` object has 3 basic properties (`url`, `name` and
`duration`) and an optional `attributes` dictionary.

For example:

```python
from ipytv.channel import IPTVAttr, IPTVChannel

channel = IPTVChannel(
    url="http://myown.link:80/luke/210274/78482",
    name="Rai 1",
    duration="-1",
    attributes={
        IPTVAttr.TVG_ID.value: "Rai 1",
        IPTVAttr.TVG_NAME.value: "Rai 1",
        IPTVAttr.TVG_LOGO.value: "https://static.epg.best/it/RaiUno.it.png",
        IPTVAttr.GROUP_TITLE.value: "RAI"
    }
)
print(channel.name)
print(channel.attributes[IPTVAttr.GROUP_TITLE.value])
```
The `IPTVAttr` enum class contains tags that are commonly found in IPTV
Playlists.

## Logging
IPyTV supports python's standard [logging system](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

To enable IPyTV's logging, add a logging configuration to your application:
```python
import logging
import ipytv
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
pl = ipytv.M3UPlaylist.loadu("https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/categories/classic.m3u")
```

## Format considerations
The extensions to the `#EXTM3U` and `#EXTINF` tags introduced by the M3U Plus
format have broken the compatibility with the M3U8 format.

This is what a standard `#EXTINF` row should look like:
```text
#EXTINF:-1,Rai 1
```
The [format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-4.3.2.1) is pretty
straightforward:
```text
#EXTINF:<duration>,[<title>]
```
Let's break it down:
1. the `#EXTINF:` tag
1. the duration of the content (as an integer or float, signed or not)
1. a comma character
1. a title

This is what an `#EXTINF` row in the M3U Plus format looks like:
```text
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="Rai 1" tvg-name="Rai 1" tvg-logo="https://static.epg.best/it/RaiUno.it.png" group-title="RAI",Rai 1
```
If we break it down, we see that points 3. and 4. have been added (and they
break the previous definition for the `#EXTINF` tag):
1. the `#EXTINF:` tag
1. the duration of the content (as an integer or float, signed or not)
1. a space
1. a variable-length, space-separated list of attributes 
1. a comma character
1. a title

The attributes in point 4 are in the `attribute="value"` format, where _value_
may also contain non-escaped commas (and this really complicates the parsing
logic).

It's worth noting that the M3U8 RFC document specifies how
[attribute lists](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8216#section-4.2) should be
formatted, but the M3U Plus implementation doesn't comply with the standard.

In conclusion, the M3U Plus format with its quirks and idiosyncrasies is hard to
read for humans and hard to parse for computers. It's an ugly format, but it's
too widespread to be ignored and for Python to lack a parsing library.

On a funny note, this is how the VLC programmers named the
[parsing function](https://github.com/videolan/vlc/blob/474c90392ede9916f068fcb3f860ba220d4c5b11/modules/demux/playlist/m3u.c#L398)
for the IPTV playlists in the M3U Plus format:
```c
static void parseEXTINFIptvDiots(...)
```
Just saying... :sweat_smile:
